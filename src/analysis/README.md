# Analysis Module

This module provides a suite of analysis methods to analyse gaze and blink measures from recorded eye-tracking data. <br>a
The module functions can also be accessed with the [Offline Interface](/src/offlineInterface/) or exported independently to analysis environments. <br>
For example, see our analysis notebook for the Utility Test included in the SocialEyes paper: `Utility test analysis code/Analysis.ipynb`.
